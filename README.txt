Introduction
------------

This package presents a number of methods for querying webservices for
bibliographic information, primarily via the ISBN.


Usage
-----




Caveats and bugs
----------------

Several web-services require keys for access. Users are directed to obtain
these themselves.

Almost all webservices have a query limit imposed on them, e.g. 1 per second
or 1000 a day per IP. This package tries to enforce those limits

  to have disappeared from its home website.
